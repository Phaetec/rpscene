        <text>Curse: This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the armor or
            you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or
            similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed you have vulnerability to piercing
            and slashing damage.

        <text>While holding this shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to animate. The
            shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your
            hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to end this effect, or
            until you are incapacitated or die, at which point the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you
            have one free.
